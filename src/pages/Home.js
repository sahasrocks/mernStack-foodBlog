            <p className="mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4"> It was started as a casual hobby for founders Priyansh(aka priyanz) and Sahas(aka sahasrocks).From the blog’s homepage, you can quickly find recipes by clicking on categories like healthy, vegetarian, instant pot, meal prep, and more. As you scroll further down, you can check out the latest recipes from the blog.  The overall blog design is clean and simple. The white background puts the focus on the beautiful food photos. Purple and orange are used to pull attention to buttons, calls-to-actions, and other important information.  Pinch of Yum also displays a lead magnet form on the homepage. When visitors sign up with their email address, they’ll get an ebook of recipes in return. This is a great way to grow your email list super fast.</p>
